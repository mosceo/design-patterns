Iterator Pattern
================

Purpose
-------

The patterns helps us to traverse collections of objects in the same manner. Different collections can have different underlying implementations. But if they provide an iterator of the same type, the client code can work with all these collections uniformly. The pattern helps us to decouple the client code from the collections' underlying implementation.
