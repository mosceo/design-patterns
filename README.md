Design Patterns
===============
Most popular design patterns implemented in PHP.

List of patterns
----------------
* Strategy — change algorithms in runtime
* Observer — when some object changes, others get notified
* Decorator — wrap objects in other objects to extend behaviour
* Singleton — make sure there is only one instance of the class
* Command — encapsulate a request as an object and pass it around
* Adapter — translate one interface to another the client code expects
* Facade — make a simple interface to a complex subsystem
* TemplateMethod — redefine certain steps of an algorithm in subclasses
* Iterator — traverse a collection of objects
* Composite — construct a tree-like structure of objects of the same type
