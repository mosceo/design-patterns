Composite Pattern
=================

Purpose
-------
The pattern allows us to construct a tree-like structure of objects and treat both composite nodes and leafs uniformly.

Examples
--------
User interface elements often contain other elements, and rendering these elements requires rendering their children elements.

Figures like circles and squares in a drawing program can contain other figures inside.
Rescaling one of such figures will require similar rescaling of the figures inside.
