Facade Pattern
==============

Purpose
-------

If the client code has to work with a complex subsystem consisting of many objects, you can use the Facade Pattern to create a simple interface to this subsystem. For example, instead of calling methods on many objects the client code can call one method on a facade object and this method will do all the job.
